  <p><em>This post is meant as a primer on COINTELPRO. A large part of the course was
spent on the surveillance of social movements, but surveillance in general and
surveillance of social movements in particular cannot be properly understood
without some background on COINTELPRO.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In 1971, a group of activists called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_Commission_to_Investigate_the_FBI">Citizens&rsquo; Commission to Investigate
the
FBI</a>
broke into an FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania. The group found over a
thousand classified documents which they shared with the press. The story
behind the break-in is recounted in this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjVcS4yGcSY">video</a>, the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Burglary-Discovery-Edgar-Hoovers-Secret/dp/0307962954">The
Burglary</a>
and the film <a href="https://www.1971film.com/">1971</a> on Netflix. These documents
revealed, for the first time, the existence of a covert FBI operation called
COINTELPRO whose goal was  to disrupt and neutralize domestic groups perceived
as threats.  A few years later, in 1974, the New York Times revealed the
existence of a CIA report called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Jewels_(Central_Intelligence_Agency)">Family
Jewels</a>.
The report described many covert CIA operations, including behavior
modification research, surveillance of domestic protestors, and assassination
attempts against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro">Fidel Castro</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba">Patrice Lumumba</a>, among others.</p>
<p>The disclosures of COINTELPRO and of Family Jewels pushed the US Senate to
establish a committee&mdash;informally called the Church committee&mdash;to investigate
the abuses of the US Intelligence Community. The committee produced what is
referred to as the <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/94755_II.pdf">Church report</a> which describes the abuses of the CIA, the
FBI, the NSA, the IRS and certain parts of the Department of Justice and of the
State Department.</p>
<p><em>Everything described in the rest of the post is straight from the Church
report</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Overview.</strong>
COINTELPRO was started in 1956 for the purpose of running counterintelligence
operations against communist groups in the US. It lasted until  1971 and
consisted of over 2000 approved actions. It&rsquo;s important to understand that the
nature of the program was <em>counterintelligence</em> and not <em>criminal
investigation</em> which is what people typically associate with the FBI.  The
differences are important. Roughly speaking, the goal of a criminal
investigation is to get a conviction, whereas the goal of a counterintelligence
operation is to undermine and neutralize hostile agents.</p>
<p>As we will see, there were a lot of serious abuses with COINTELPRO, including
actions that were unconstitutional and clearly immoral and illegal.  But it&rsquo;s
important to also understand that the high-level goal of the program was to
maintain the existing social order of the time. In fact, the Church report
itself states,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The unexpressed major premise of much of COINTELPRO is that the Bureau has a
role in maintaining the existing social order, and that its efforts should be
aimed toward combatting those who threaten that order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to keep in the mind the historical and social context of the
time. The 1960&rsquo;s were a time when many important social movements were born
including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_liberation_movement">Women&rsquo;s
Liberation</a>
movement, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement">Civil
Rights</a> movement, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_social_movements#Gay_Liberation_movement_(1969%E2%80%931974)">Gay
Liberation</a>
movement and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_United_States_involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War">Anti-War</a>
movement.</p>
<h3 id="the-targets">The Targets</h3>
<p>During its 15 years of existence, COINTELPRO targeted four types of groups
which it labeled as: <em>Communist</em> groups, <em>White Hate</em> groups, <em>Black
Nationalist</em> groups and the <em>New Left</em>.</p>
<p>The Communist groups included the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_USA">Communist Party USA</a> (CPUSA) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Workers_Party_(United_States)">Socialist Workers Party</a> (SWP).</p>
<p>The <em>White Hate</em> groups included the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan">Ku Klux
Klan</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Nazi_Party">American Nazi
Party</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_States%27_Rights_Party">National
States&rsquo; Right
Party</a>.  For the
most part, and unlike the other programs, the scope of White Hate program
remained narrowly focused on its initial targets and, as the report states,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No legitimate right wing organizations were drawn into the program, in
contrast with the earlier spread of the CPUSA and SWP programs to non
members.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the FBI itself, this was also the most successful of all the
programs.</p>

<p>The <em>Black Nationalist</em> program  started with the monitoring of civil rights
groups for communist influence but quickly expanded in scope.  Its targets
included the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Christian_Leadership_Conference">Southern Christian Leadership
Conference</a>
(SCLC), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP">the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People</a> (NAACP), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_Nonviolent_Coordinating_Committee">Student Nonviolent
Coordinating
Committee</a>
(SNCC), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Action_Movement">Revolutionary Action
Movement</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deacons_for_Defense_and_Justice">Deacons for Defense and
Justice</a>, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Racial_Equality">Congress of Racial
Equality</a>, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_of_Islam">Nation of Islam</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party">Black
Panther Party</a>.  The NAACP
was investigated for more than 25 years on the suspicion that its leaders
sympathized with communists; even after initial FBI reports stated that they
didn&rsquo;t.  Individuals that were targeted included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.">Dr.  Martin Luther King
Jr</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Rap_Brown">H. Rap
Brown</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Muhammad">Elijah
Muhammad</a>.  The FBI also
included &ldquo;every Black Student union and similar group regardless of their past
or present involvement in disorders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <em>New Left</em> program was started after student protests at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University_protests_of_1968">Columbia
University</a>.
The FBI was never really able to define what it meant by New Left but, roughly
speaking, it seemed to include anti-war  groups, Women&rsquo;s Liberation groups
like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_International_League_for_Peace_and_Freedom">Women&rsquo;s International League for Peace and
Freedom</a>
(WILPF) and, eventually, encompassed all student protest groups. For example,
the report describes a student that was investigated because they carried an
obscene sign in protest of their University&rsquo;s censorship of the school
newspaper.  It also included the Inter-University Committee for Debate on
Foreign Policy.</p>
<h3 id="the-goals">The Goals</h3>
<p>According to the Church report, the actions the FBI undertook against its
targets  were classified into four goals: preventing <em>speaking</em>, preventing
<em>teaching</em>, preventing <em>writing and publishing</em> and preventing <em>meetings</em>.  Specific
actions taken by the FBI included getting high school teachers and professors
fired, preventing the distribution of books and newspapers, disrupting peaceful
protests and even intervening to deny meeting spaces.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A high school teacher was investigated because they invited two poets that were
involved with the draft resistance movement to attend their class.  After this
was discovered and the ACLU got involved, the FBI sent anonymous letters to
local papers, the city&rsquo;s Board of Education and to the school administration
criticizing the ACLU&rsquo;s involvement, urging them to focus on the teacher&rsquo;s
activities, and denouncing the teacher as a convicted draft dodger.</p>
<p>The FBI also targeted a university professor who was an anti-war demonstrator.
Agents  contacted a foundation known to contribute to the university and asked
that they pressure the university to fire the professor.  Though the university
told the foundation that the professor&rsquo;s contract would not be renewed it, in
fact,  was renewed so the FBI and the foundation continued to mount pressure.
In another case, the FBI sent letters to politicians, the press and university
administrators accusing a professor of giving aid and comfort to the enemy and
suggesting that their goal was to &ldquo;&hellip;bleed the United States white by
prolonging the war in Vietnam and pave the way for a takeover by Russia&rdquo;.
Another professor was even targeted because they were the faculty advisor of a
student group that was  circulating a &ldquo;pro-student&rdquo; and anti-establishment
pamphlet.</p>
<p>The FBI often targeted newspapers including college and underground papers.  It
contacted their landlords to try to get them evicted. They sent anonymous
letters to politicians and advertisers complaining of college articles.</p>
<p>To prevent groups from meeting, the FBI contacted the owners of the meeting
spaces to pressure them to refuse to rent the space. Agents tried to get the
groups&rsquo; charters revoked. They leaked the time and place of closed meetings to
the press.  The FBI mounted disinformation campaigns against protestors by
filling out forms with fake names and addresses so that organizers could not
find housing for out of town protestors.  Agents placed fake calls to confuse a
transportation company that was hired to transport protestors and dropped  fake
leaflets on campus with different times and places for meetings.</p>
<h3 id="the-tactics">The Tactics</h3>
<p>To achieve its goals, the FBI used various techniques including propaganda,
informants and anonymous letters and phone calls.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A common theme in COINTELPRO actions was to create distrust and animosity
within groups and between groups. For example, the FBI sent an anonymous letter
to the leader of a Chicago gang telling him that the
Black Panthers had taken out a hit on him. As stated in the report the goal was to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;intensify the degree of animosity between the two groups and cause
retaliatory action which could disrupt the Black Panther Party or lead to
reprisals against its leadership.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In California, the FBI used anonymous letters to exacerbate conflicts between
the Black Panthers and a group called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Organization">US
Organization</a>. Several deaths
ensued and FBI reports said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shootings, beatings, and a high degree of unrest continues to prevail in the
ghetto area of southeast San Diego. Although no specific counterintelligence
action can be credited with contributing to this overall situation, it is
felt that a substantial amount of the unrest is directly attributable to this
program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The FBI targeted a Black veteran who was on leave from a mental hospital and
was upset with the SCLC.  Again, according to FBI reports the goal of the
operation was to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;neutralize [him] by causing his commitment to a mental
hospital, and to gain unfavorable publicity for the SCLC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The FBI also targeted the leaders of various groups, especially of the
Black Panther Party. A series of anonymous letters were sent to create a rift
between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huey_P._Newton">Huey P. Newton</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldridge_Cleaver">Eldridge Cleaver</a>. The FBI
even sent an anonymous letter to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokely_Carmichael">Stokely
Carmichael</a>&rsquo;s mother claiming
members of the Party planned to kill him.</p>
<p>Another tactic was the <em>snitch jacket</em>, where a target would be falsely labeled
as an informant. In one instance, the FBI had a police officer pick up two
anti-war protestors under false pretense and arranged for someone to radio the
officer to say that the target&mdash;a third anti-way protestor&mdash;had called and
wanted the officer to call her back.  In another example, five members of the
Black Panther Party were arrested. All but one were released and the rumor was
spread that the fifth member was released last because they had cooperated.</p>
<p>A third tactic was to interfere in a target&rsquo;s personal life. For example, the
FBI targeted a woman that was associated with WILPF as well as two groups
labeled as New Left and Black Nationalist. Agents sent anonymous letters to her
husband accusing her of infidelity. Four months after the letter was sent, the
couple had separated.</p>
<p>Letters were sent to employers of targets to get them fired. A priest that
allowed the Black Panther Party to use his church for its breakfast program was
transferred after an anonymous letter and anonymous phone calls were made to
his bishop. A television commentator that had expressed sympathy for a &ldquo;Black
Nationalist&rdquo; leader was transferred after his station received anonymous letters
from the FBI.</p>
<p>After a Black university student was arrested in a protest, the FBI sent
anonymous letters to the local prosecutor and radio to reveal that her adoptive
father was a communist. The goal was to &ldquo;aid the prosecutor in his case against
the student&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="martin-luther-king-jr">Martin Luther King Jr.</h2>
<p>The FBI targeted a lot of people under COINTELPRO but the intensity of its
actions against Martin Luther King Jr. was exceptional.  It would take too long
to properly describe the FBI&rsquo;s actions against Dr. King but, as the Church
report, states</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The FBI campaign to discredit and destroy Dr. King was marked by extreme
personal vindictiveness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. King was a target of the FBI from 1963 until his death in 1968 and, in
fact, even after.  His home was tapped from 1963 to 1965 and the headquarters of
the SCLC for even longer.  The FBI tapped his hotel rooms in the hope of
gathering evidence of adultery.</p>
<p>FBI agents flew to the Vatican to convince the Pope to cancel
a meeting with Dr. King. When he won the Nobel Peace prize, the FBI mounted a
campaign to undermine him with heads of states and ambassadors. Letters with
his forged signature were sent to donors suggesting that the SCLC was being
investigated by the IRS.</p>
<p>The FBI even sent Dr. King and his wife, Coretta Scott King, purported
recordings of his adultery with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93King_suicide_letter">letter</a>
suggesting he kill himself if he did not want the recording to be released.</p>
<p>Even after his death, the FBI lobbied  Congress to fight against the
establishment of Martin Luther King day.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>COINTELPRO was officially terminated in 1971.  The Church
report had a  big impact on how intelligence and counterintelligence is
conducted in the US. Among other things, it lead to the ban of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11905">political assassinations</a> and to
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Act">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act</a>
(FISA).
Even though COINTELPRO was terminated, the FBI continues to
surveil domestic groups, including activists.</p>

  <p><em>The first paper we covered was Phil Rogaway&rsquo;s <a href="https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/moral-fn.pdf">The Moral
Character of <strong>Cryptographic</strong>
Work</a>. The paper
centers around the moral and ethical responsibilities of cryptographers but its
themes are relevant and applicable to computer science as a whole.  This was a
useful paper for us to discuss early in the course so that we could cover
important notions for the rest of the course.</em></p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The paper is divided into four parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Social responsibility of scientists &amp; engineers</em>: is a broad discussion about the ethical responsibilities of scientists;</li>
<li><em>Political character of cryptographic work</em>: discusses the inherent political nature of cryptography and the apolitical culture of part of the academic cryptography community;</li>
<li><em>The dystopian world of pervasive surveillance</em>: describes two opposing framings of mass surveillance;</li>
<li><em>Creating a more just and useful field</em>: describes a set of problems that Rogaway believes cryptographers should work on.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Social responsibility of scientists &amp; engineers.</strong>
In this section, Rogaway discusses the post World War II scientific
&ldquo;ethic of responsibility&rdquo;. He describes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%E2%80%93Einstein_Manifesto">Russell-Einstein
manifesto</a>
from 1955 which called for nuclear disarmament and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugwash_Conferences_on_Science_and_World_Affairs">Pugwash Conference on
Science and World
Affairs</a>
which played an important role in disarmament and diplomacy.  He then
argues that technical work itself can be political and that, in response,
scientists can engage in politics in one of two ways.  The first is via
<em>implicit politics</em>, where a scientist affects politics as a byproduct of their
technical work. The second is via <em>overt politics</em> where a scientist affects
politics through activism.</p>
<p>Rogaway then describes three historical events that shaped scientists&rsquo; ethics of
responsibility: the experience of physicists after the invention
of nuclear weapons; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials">Nuremberg
trials</a> which established the idea that following orders does not absolve one from moral responsibility; and the rise of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_movement#Formation_of_environmental_protection_societies">environmental
movement</a>.
According to Rogaway, these events lead to a sort of &ldquo;golden era&rdquo; of scientific
responsibility where ethics and social concerns were the norm in scientific
work.</p>
<p>Yet, he points out, in recent decades the ethics of responsibility in science
has eroded considerably. He describes several instances of scientists
and other academics that choose to explicitly take amoral and apolitical
stands.  This is summarized in the following quote from Stanley Fisch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;don&rsquo;t confuse your academic obligations with the obligation to save the
world; that&rsquo;s not your job as an academic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rogaway speculates as to what caused this decline and believes that it is,
in part, due to  the rise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_utopianism">technological
optimism</a>.
Technological optimism is the idea that technology is inherently
positive and that technological innovation will solve most of humanity&rsquo;s
problems.  Rogaway&rsquo;s argument is, roughly speaking, that technological
optimists equate technology with progress and this eliminates the need to
think critically about one&rsquo;s work. In other words, since the act of creating
technology is inherently good why should we, as technology builders, even worry
about the consequences of our work? A contrary perspective is that of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pessimism#Technological_and_environmental">technological
pessimists</a>
who believe that technology does not lead to progress and point to weapons of
mass destruction and the environmental crisis as one of many examples of
technology&rsquo;s negative impact. Somewhere in the middle are technological
contextualists who acknowledge technology&rsquo;s negative impacts but believe it can
be directed and harnessed towards positive outcomes.</p>
<p>Rogaway ends this section with a reminder of scientist&rsquo;s ethical
responsibilities. The first is that one&rsquo;s role is not simply to &ldquo;do no harm&rdquo;
but to actively pursue social good. The second is that the responsibilities of a
scientist  extend  beyond herself all the way to her community, i.e., as a
scientist you are morally responsible for the impact of your scientific
community.</p>
<p><strong>The political character of cryptographic work.</strong>
Here, Rogaway argues that cryptography is inherently political but
that its political nature has been erased in part of the academic cryptography
community. He recalls that, in the early days of modern cryptography (late
70&rsquo;s and early 80&rsquo;s), cryptography research was often motivated by political
questions.  He then describes how academic cryptography eventually fragmented
into two communities represented, roughly speaking,  by the
<a href="https://www.iacr.org/">IACR</a> community (CRYPTO,
Eurocrypt, Asiacrypt and TCC) and the <a href="https://petsymposium.org/">PETS</a>
community.  Rogaway illustrates his point using two papers that were published
around the same time: Chaum&rsquo;s  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/358549.358563">Untraceable electronic mail, return addresses,
and digital pseudonyms</a>
[Chaum81], which is highly influential at PETS;  and Goldwasser and Micali&rsquo;s <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/pubs/shafi/1984-jcss.pdf">Probabilistic
Encryption</a> [GM82], which is highly influential in IACR conferences.
Rogaway then states</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Papers citing [GM82] frame problems scientifically. Authors claim to solve
important technical questions. The tone is assertive, with hints of
technological optimism. In marked contrast, papers citing [Chaum81] frame
problems socio-politically. Authors speak about some social problem or need.
The tone is reserved and explicitly contextualist views are routine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then discusses another cryptographic community: the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk">cypherpunks</a> whose principles can be
roughly articulated as the pursuit of individual privacy against governments
and corporations through the use of open and freely available cryptography. The
section ends with a survey of various cryptographic primitives that Rogaway
argues embed political and sometimes even authoritarian principles.</p>

<p><strong>The dystopian world of pervasive surveillance.</strong>
In this section, Rogaway presents two different framings of mass surveillance:
one from law enforcement which frames privacy as a personal good and
(national) security as a collective good; and one from surveillance studies
which frames both privacy and security as collective goods.  The Law
Enforcement argument is that the widespread deployment of
encryption is increasing personal privacy at the cost of national security. Law
enforcement agencies are &ldquo;<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/operational-technology/going-dark">going
dark</a>&rdquo; due to
encryption and their ability to protect the nation is rapidly deteriorating.  The
privacy and surveillance studies argument, on the other hand, is that Law
Enforcement has access to an unprecedented amount of information about people
and that that is certainly enough for it to accomplish its mission. Trying to
stop the deployment of encryption and other cryptographic technologies not only
weakens people&rsquo;s individual privacy but weakens the social goods that privacy
enables like dissent and social progress.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a more just and useful field.</strong>
In the final section, Rogaway describes technical problems cryptographers
should work on if they want to help build a better field. This discussion is
very crypto-centric so we won&rsquo;t summarize it here but only mention that he
advocates for cryptographers to expand the problems they work on to include
surveillance-motivated research. Rogaway also discusses funding, claiming that
most of the funding for cryptography research (in the U.S.) comes from the
Department of Defense (DoD) and advocates that academics &ldquo;think twice, and then
again, about accepting military funding&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="our-discussion">Our Discussion</h3>
<p>We agreed with many of Rogaway&rsquo;s points. In particular, with the pervasiveness
of technological optimism in our field and decline of ethical responsibility in
science.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical responsibility.</strong>
Most of us agreed that scientists should be bound by the ethics
of responsibility that Rogaway summarizes. One of us, however,  did not agree
and believed that scientists and engineers  should focus on
creating technology and not on technology&rsquo;s social implications, which should
be left to others.  Though this was a  minority view, we also understand that
Brown is perhaps not completely representative of the entire political spectrum
and that this perspective is surely more common in the wider computer science
community.</p>
<p>Another issue we discussed was that the scientists and communities that
shaped the post-war ethic of responsibility were overwhelmingly white and male.
Many of us felt that this was important because people&rsquo;s values and and moral
code are shaped by their background and experiences. And without diverse
perspectives, the range and scope of possible ethical codes that were
considered at the time were likely very narrow.</p>
<p><strong>The decline of ethical responsibility.</strong>
We discussed <em>why</em> ethical responsibility in science
declined. Rogaway&rsquo;s hypothesis is that it is, in part,  linked to an
increase  in individualism and in technological optimism. There is, however,  another
perhaps more cynical hypothesis: maybe scientists have never been <em>that</em>
ethically engaged in the first place. The historical events that lead to the
post-war golden era of responsibility were atypical.  The use of nuclear
weapons and the concentration camps of Nazi Germany were two of the worst
atrocities committed in human history.  So it is not surprising that scientists
had to reconcile with these events and respond in a way that changed their view
of moral responsibility.</p>
<p>But is this really the standard to which scientists and engineers should be
held today?  It should not take genocide and the  creation of new weapons of
mass destruction to galvanize our community to develop and adhere to ethical
standards.  These atrocities were highly visible and hard to ignore.  But the
everyday minutiae of working on morally gray problems is easier to overlook.
And if we don&rsquo;t provide everyday scientists and engineers the tools and
frameworks to evaluate the ethics and social impact of their own work, we will
continue to leave morality aside in the pursuit of academic and entrepreneurial
success.</p>
<p>With this in mind, is it then surprising that the ethos of responsibility did
not survive? It was created as a reaction to extreme events but it did not
fundamentally change how science is conducted or how students in STEM are
educated.</p>
<p><strong>A new ethics of responsibility.</strong>
We also talked about whether today&rsquo;s ethic of responsibility should still be
founded on the post-war ethics? Should it ask for more? If so what?  Many of
our students were born in the 2000&rsquo;s and grew up in a world that is markedly
different from Einstein and Russel&rsquo;s. This also related to our discussion about
the lack of diversity in post-war science. So the question was: given the
current state of the world and a (slightly?) more diverse scientific community,
what should today&rsquo;s ethic of responsibility look like?</p>
<p><strong>Fragmentation of academic cryptography.</strong>
Those of us that worked in cryptography agreed with Rogaway&rsquo;s description of
our field and of the apolitical culture of the IACR community. Nobody felt this
was particularly controversial; it is obvious to anyone who reads the
proceedings and attends the conferences.</p>
<p>Since this was obvious, our conversation focused more on <em>why</em> this might be
the case. One of Rogaway&rsquo;s observations is that the IACR community is
technologically optimist whereas the PETS community is technologically
contextualist.  Another reason, however, might be because the cryptography community
lacks diversity; both demographic diversity and  intellectual diversity. In
fact, we talked about <em>who</em> exactly becomes a cryptographer? What experiences
do they bring to the table? How are they trained?  Many (if not most) people in
this community come from a math and theoretical computer science background.
Most have been educated and trained at one of a handful of institutions. Most
of the community&rsquo;s academic lineage can even be traced back to a handful of
people.</p>
<p>We agreed with Rogaway&rsquo;s call for the community to expand the scope of problems
it works on. But we also wanted the community to be more intentional about
diversifying itself. A scientist&rsquo; s choice of problems is shaped by who
they are. Including  people of different backgrounds would expand the scope of
research and provide wider perspectives.  IACR sponsors non-US conferences
like Eurocrypt, Asiacrypt and Africacrypt but anyone familiar with these venues
knows that they are not designed to promote a local view of cryptographic
research; i.e., the same problems studied at CRYPTO are studied at Asiacrypt
and at Africacrypt.  Can we really have a conversation about the moral
character of cryptographic work without expanding who has access to which
platforms or addressing how we gate-keep as a community?</p>
<p><strong>Funding.</strong>
For context, our discussions occurred against the backdrop of the Jeffrey
Epstein scandal and Ronan Farrow&rsquo;s story about the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-an-elite-university-research-center-concealed-its-relationship-with-jeffrey-epstein">MIT Media
Lab</a>&rsquo; s
financial relationship with Epstein. So we spent a lot of time discussing
funding.  Wile Rogaway&rsquo;s funding critique centered around individual
academics&rsquo; choice of taking DoD money, ours centered around the
<em>institutions</em> in which these academics worked, i.e., Universities. Asking
individual faculty to be circumspect about their funding is great but if the
institutions they work for: (1) do  not fund their research; but (2) evaluate
and promote them based on their research; and (3) pressure them to obtain
funding so that they can pay their summer salaries and fund their PhD students;
then these institutions need to shoulder some  of the responsibility.
To be clear, none of us felt that  apportioning blame to Universities
absolved faculty from their decisions and certainly not Joi Ito and
the Media Lab. But we did feel like any conversation about funding needs to
include a broader discussion about how academic research is funded and the
incentives that creates for individual faculty.</p>
<p><strong>Editorial note on algorithmic fairness.</strong>
Looking back on this discussion, the issues surrounding the fragmentation of
the cryptography community seem particularly relevant to what is happening in
the field of algorithmic fairness. The first conference on the subject,
<a href="https://facctconference.org/">FaccT</a>, advocates for interdisciplinary work
that is rooted in and informed by the social context surrounding fairness,
accountability and transparency. From the FaccT webpage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Research challenges are not limited to technological solutions regarding
potential bias, but include the question of whether decisions should be
outsourced to data- and code-driven computing systems. We particularly seek
to evaluate technical solutions with respect to existing problems, reflecting
upon their benefits and risks; to address pivotal questions about economic
incentive structures, perverse implications, distribution of power, and
redistribution of welfare; and to ground research on fairness,
accountability, and transparency in existing legal requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, the more recent <a href="https://responsiblecomputing.org/">Foundations of Responsible
Computing</a> (FORC) emphasises the
mathematical, algorithmic, statistical and economics aspects
of responsible computing. From the FORC website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Symposium on Foundations of Responsible Computing (FORC) is a forum for
mathematical research in computation and society writ large.  The Symposium
aims to catalyze the formation of a community supportive of the application
of theoretical computer science, statistics, economics and other relevant
analytical fields to problems of pressing and anticipated societal concern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as cryptography is inherently political, algorithmic fairness is
inherently social and political so it will be interesting to see how this
community chooses to evolve.</p>

  <p>In Fall 2019, I taught a course called <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~seny/2950v/">Crypto for Social
Good</a>. I didn&rsquo;t like the name but I had to
make a quick decision and that was the best I could come up with at the time.
I had a sense of the topics I wanted to cover but I didn&rsquo;t have a way to
capture the essence of the course.</p>
<p>In fact, on the first day of class I told my students:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what this course is about, but we&rsquo;re going to figure it
out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we did. What we found is that the course was about <em>the impact of computer
science and technology on marginalized groups</em>. The course had a privacy and
surveillance bias to it because that&rsquo;s what I work on, but we had
students from a variety of CS backgrounds including AI/ML, robotics and systems
so our discussions ended up being somewhat broader (though we unfortunately did
not have any students from the social sciences).</p>
<p>My motivation for creating the course was frustration. I have studied computer
science for almost 25 years.  I have worked on cryptography for over 15 years.
I worked at Microsoft Research for 8 years. I spent a year and half on a
National Academy of Sciences committee studying the impact of encryption on law
enforcement and national security. I went all the way from being a confused
undergraduate computer science major to an Associate Professor  and, until very recently,
I never attended a lecture or had a conversation with other computer scientists about
the specific impact that technology has on marginalized groups.</p>
<p>Of course, teaching and research on this subject did exist <em>outside of CS</em> but
my point is that I never encountered any <em>computer science</em> work that focused
on the experiences of marginalized people.  This leads me to believe that, as a
field, we don&rsquo;t really care.  At least not in a meaningful way.  We write
diversity and inclusion statements but we don&rsquo;t do research or build
technologies that address the problems of marginalized communities.</p>
<p>So this is why I created the course. But what is <em>this blog</em> about? During our
time together, my students and I read, analyzed and discussed many
reports and articles and we thought a lot about computer science&rsquo;s role (and
sometimes absence) in various social problems. We thought about the problems that different
communities were facing and whether technology-based solutions even made
sense (often they didn&rsquo;t!). In some cases, we also sketched new technologies
that could potentially impact these communities in a positive way. None of
these discussions were authoritative. We didn&rsquo;t come up with any definitive
answers; but we weren&rsquo;t trying to. Our goal was to educate ourselves and
reflect. To imagine what computer science would look like if the interests of
marginalized people were taken seriously by the field.</p>
<p>I think the results of our work are important and, as far as I know, somewhat
unique so this blog will serve as a way to communicate them to those who are
interested.  I will post summaries and analyses of our readings and,
eventually, the research that came out of that.</p>
<p>Posts related to class discussions will be authored as a group named 2950v-XX,
where XX will be the course year. I decided on group authorship to
protect the students&rsquo; privacy and to avoid them being targeted.</p>
<p>For Fall 2020, I plan on broadening the class beyond crypto and on changing the
name to “Algorithms for the People”. I feel that it better captures what the
course was always about; even if I didn&rsquo;t realize it at first.</p>
