centers around the moral and ethical responsibilities of cryptographers but its
themes are relevant and applicable to computer science as a whole.  This was a
useful paper for us to discuss early in the course so that we could cover
important notions for the rest of the course.</em></p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The paper is divided into four parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Social responsibility of scientists &amp; engineers</em>: is a broad discussion about the ethical responsibilities of scientists;</li>
<li><em>Political character of cryptographic work</em>: discusses the inherent political nature of cryptography and the apolitical culture of part of the academic cryptography community;</li>
<li><em>The dystopian world of pervasive surveillance</em>: describes two opposing framings of mass surveillance;</li>
<li><em>Creating a more just and useful field</em>: describes a set of problems that Rogaway believes cryptographers should work on.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Social responsibility of scientists &amp; engineers.</strong>
In this section, Rogaway discusses the post World War II scientific
&ldquo;ethic of responsibility&rdquo;. He describes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%E2%80%93Einstein_Manifesto">Russell-Einstein
manifesto</a>
from 1955 which called for nuclear disarmament and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugwash_Conferences_on_Science_and_World_Affairs">Pugwash Conference on
Science and World
Affairs</a>
which played an important role in disarmament and diplomacy.  He then
argues that technical work itself can be political and that, in response,
scientists can engage in politics in one of two ways.  The first is via
<em>implicit politics</em>, where a scientist affects politics as a byproduct of their
technical work. The second is via <em>overt politics</em> where a scientist affects
politics through activism.</p>
<p>Rogaway then describes three historical events that shaped scientists&rsquo; ethics of
responsibility: the experience of physicists after the invention
of nuclear weapons; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials">Nuremberg
trials</a> which established the idea that following orders does not absolve one from moral responsibility; and the rise of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_movement#Formation_of_environmental_protection_societies">environmental
movement</a>.
According to Rogaway, these events lead to a sort of &ldquo;golden era&rdquo; of scientific
responsibility where ethics and social concerns were the norm in scientific
work.</p>
<p>Yet, he points out, in recent decades the ethics of responsibility in science
has eroded considerably. He describes several instances of scientists
and other academics that choose to explicitly take amoral and apolitical
stands.  This is summarized in the following quote from Stanley Fisch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;don&rsquo;t confuse your academic obligations with the obligation to save the
world; that&rsquo;s not your job as an academic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rogaway speculates as to what caused this decline and believes that it is,
in part, due to  the rise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_utopianism">technological
optimism</a>.
Technological optimism is the idea that technology is inherently
positive and that technological innovation will solve most of humanity&rsquo;s
problems.  Rogaway&rsquo;s argument is, roughly speaking, that technological
optimists equate technology with progress and this eliminates the need to
think critically about one&rsquo;s work. In other words, since the act of creating
technology is inherently good why should we, as technology builders, even worry
about the consequences of our work? A contrary perspective is that of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pessimism#Technological_and_environmental">technological
pessimists</a>
who believe that technology does not lead to progress and point to weapons of
mass destruction and the environmental crisis as one of many examples of
technology&rsquo;s negative impact. Somewhere in the middle are technological
contextualists who acknowledge technology&rsquo;s negative impacts but believe it can
be directed and harnessed towards positive outcomes.</p>
<p>Rogaway ends this section with a reminder of scientist&rsquo;s ethical
responsibilities. The first is that one&rsquo;s role is not simply to &ldquo;do no harm&rdquo;
but to actively pursue social good. The second is that the responsibilities of a
scientist  extend  beyond herself all the way to her community, i.e., as a
scientist you are morally responsible for the impact of your scientific
community.</p>
<p><strong>The political character of cryptographic work.</strong>
Here, Rogaway argues that cryptography is inherently political but
that its political nature has been erased in part of the academic cryptography
community. He recalls that, in the early days of modern cryptography (late
70&rsquo;s and early 80&rsquo;s), cryptography research was often motivated by political
questions.  He then describes how academic cryptography eventually fragmented
into two communities represented, roughly speaking,  by the
<a href="https://www.iacr.org/">IACR</a> community (CRYPTO,
Eurocrypt, Asiacrypt and TCC) and the <a href="https://petsymposium.org/">PETS</a>
community.  Rogaway illustrates his point using two papers that were published
around the same time: Chaum&rsquo;s  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/358549.358563">Untraceable electronic mail, return addresses,
and digital pseudonyms</a>
[Chaum81], which is highly influential at PETS;  and Goldwasser and Micali&rsquo;s <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/pubs/shafi/1984-jcss.pdf">Probabilistic
Encryption</a> [GM82], which is highly influential in IACR conferences.
Rogaway then states</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Papers citing [GM82] frame problems scientifically. Authors claim to solve
important technical questions. The tone is assertive, with hints of
technological optimism. In marked contrast, papers citing [Chaum81] frame
problems socio-politically. Authors speak about some social problem or need.
The tone is reserved and explicitly contextualist views are routine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then discusses another cryptographic community: the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk">cypherpunks</a> whose principles can be
roughly articulated as the pursuit of individual privacy against governments
and corporations through the use of open and freely available cryptography. The
section ends with a survey of various cryptographic primitives that Rogaway
argues embed political and sometimes even authoritarian principles.</p>

<p><strong>The dystopian world of pervasive surveillance.</strong>
In this section, Rogaway presents two different framings of mass surveillance:
one from law enforcement which frames privacy as a personal good and
(national) security as a collective good; and one from surveillance studies
which frames both privacy and security as collective goods.  The Law
Enforcement argument is that the widespread deployment of
encryption is increasing personal privacy at the cost of national security. Law
enforcement agencies are &ldquo;<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/operational-technology/going-dark">going
dark</a>&rdquo; due to
encryption and their ability to protect the nation is rapidly deteriorating.  The
privacy and surveillance studies argument, on the other hand, is that Law
Enforcement has access to an unprecedented amount of information about people
and that that is certainly enough for it to accomplish its mission. Trying to
stop the deployment of encryption and other cryptographic technologies not only
weakens people&rsquo;s individual privacy but weakens the social goods that privacy
enables like dissent and social progress.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a more just and useful field.</strong>
In the final section, Rogaway describes technical problems cryptographers
should work on if they want to help build a better field. This discussion is
very crypto-centric so we won&rsquo;t summarize it here but only mention that he
advocates for cryptographers to expand the problems they work on to include
surveillance-motivated research. Rogaway also discusses funding, claiming that
most of the funding for cryptography research (in the U.S.) comes from the
Department of Defense (DoD) and advocates that academics &ldquo;think twice, and then
again, about accepting military funding&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="our-discussion">Our Discussion</h3>
<p>We agreed with many of Rogaway&rsquo;s points. In particular, with the pervasiveness
of technological optimism in our field and decline of ethical responsibility in
science.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical responsibility.</strong>
Most of us agreed that scientists should be bound by the ethics
of responsibility that Rogaway summarizes. One of us, however,  did not agree
and believed that scientists and engineers  should focus on
creating technology and not on technology&rsquo;s social implications, which should
be left to others.  Though this was a  minority view, we also understand that
Brown is perhaps not completely representative of the entire political spectrum
and that this perspective is surely more common in the wider computer science
community.</p>
<p>Another issue we discussed was that the scientists and communities that
shaped the post-war ethic of responsibility were overwhelmingly white and male.
Many of us felt that this was important because people&rsquo;s values and and moral
code are shaped by their background and experiences. And without diverse
perspectives, the range and scope of possible ethical codes that were
considered at the time were likely very narrow.</p>
<p><strong>The decline of ethical responsibility.</strong>
We discussed <em>why</em> ethical responsibility in science
declined. Rogaway&rsquo;s hypothesis is that it is, in part,  linked to an
increase  in individualism and in technological optimism. There is, however,  another
perhaps more cynical hypothesis: maybe scientists have never been <em>that</em>
ethically engaged in the first place. The historical events that lead to the
post-war golden era of responsibility were atypical.  The use of nuclear
weapons and the concentration camps of Nazi Germany were two of the worst
atrocities committed in human history.  So it is not surprising that scientists
had to reconcile with these events and respond in a way that changed their view
of moral responsibility.</p>
<p>But is this really the standard to which scientists and engineers should be
held today?  It should not take genocide and the  creation of new weapons of
mass destruction to galvanize our community to develop and adhere to ethical
standards.  These atrocities were highly visible and hard to ignore.  But the
everyday minutiae of working on morally gray problems is easier to overlook.
And if we don&rsquo;t provide everyday scientists and engineers the tools and
frameworks to evaluate the ethics and social impact of their own work, we will
continue to leave morality aside in the pursuit of academic and entrepreneurial
success.</p>
<p>With this in mind, is it then surprising that the ethos of responsibility did
not survive? It was created as a reaction to extreme events but it did not
fundamentally change how science is conducted or how students in STEM are
educated.</p>
<p><strong>A new ethics of responsibility.</strong>
We also talked about whether today&rsquo;s ethic of responsibility should still be
founded on the post-war ethics? Should it ask for more? If so what?  Many of
our students were born in the 2000&rsquo;s and grew up in a world that is markedly
different from Einstein and Russel&rsquo;s. This also related to our discussion about
the lack of diversity in post-war science. So the question was: given the
current state of the world and a (slightly?) more diverse scientific community,
what should today&rsquo;s ethic of responsibility look like?</p>
<p><strong>Fragmentation of academic cryptography.</strong>
Those of us that worked in cryptography agreed with Rogaway&rsquo;s description of
our field and of the apolitical culture of the IACR community. Nobody felt this
was particularly controversial; it is obvious to anyone who reads the
proceedings and attends the conferences.</p>
<p>Since this was obvious, our conversation focused more on <em>why</em> this might be
the case. One of Rogaway&rsquo;s observations is that the IACR community is
technologically optimist whereas the PETS community is technologically
contextualist.  Another reason, however, might be because the cryptography community
lacks diversity; both demographic diversity and  intellectual diversity. In
fact, we talked about <em>who</em> exactly becomes a cryptographer? What experiences
do they bring to the table? How are they trained?  Many (if not most) people in
this community come from a math and theoretical computer science background.
Most have been educated and trained at one of a handful of institutions. Most
of the community&rsquo;s academic lineage can even be traced back to a handful of
people.</p>
<p>We agreed with Rogaway&rsquo;s call for the community to expand the scope of problems
it works on. But we also wanted the community to be more intentional about
diversifying itself. A scientist&rsquo; s choice of problems is shaped by who
they are. Including  people of different backgrounds would expand the scope of
research and provide wider perspectives.  IACR sponsors non-US conferences
like Eurocrypt, Asiacrypt and Africacrypt but anyone familiar with these venues
knows that they are not designed to promote a local view of cryptographic
research; i.e., the same problems studied at CRYPTO are studied at Asiacrypt
and at Africacrypt.  Can we really have a conversation about the moral
character of cryptographic work without expanding who has access to which
platforms or addressing how we gate-keep as a community?</p>
<p><strong>Funding.</strong>
For context, our discussions occurred against the backdrop of the Jeffrey
Epstein scandal and Ronan Farrow&rsquo;s story about the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-an-elite-university-research-center-concealed-its-relationship-with-jeffrey-epstein">MIT Media
Lab</a>&rsquo; s
financial relationship with Epstein. So we spent a lot of time discussing
funding.  Wile Rogaway&rsquo;s funding critique centered around individual
academics&rsquo; choice of taking DoD money, ours centered around the
<em>institutions</em> in which these academics worked, i.e., Universities. Asking
individual faculty to be circumspect about their funding is great but if the
institutions they work for: (1) do  not fund their research; but (2) evaluate
and promote them based on their research; and (3) pressure them to obtain
funding so that they can pay their summer salaries and fund their PhD students;
then these institutions need to shoulder some  of the responsibility.
To be clear, none of us felt that  apportioning blame to Universities
absolved faculty from their decisions and certainly not Joi Ito and
the Media Lab. But we did feel like any conversation about funding needs to
include a broader discussion about how academic research is funded and the
incentives that creates for individual faculty.</p>
<p><strong>Editorial note on algorithmic fairness.</strong>
Looking back on this discussion, the issues surrounding the fragmentation of
the cryptography community seem particularly relevant to what is happening in
the field of algorithmic fairness. The first conference on the subject,
<a href="https://facctconference.org/">FaccT</a>, advocates for interdisciplinary work
that is rooted in and informed by the social context surrounding fairness,
accountability and transparency. From the FaccT webpage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Research challenges are not limited to technological solutions regarding
potential bias, but include the question of whether decisions should be
outsourced to data- and code-driven computing systems. We particularly seek
to evaluate technical solutions with respect to existing problems, reflecting
upon their benefits and risks; to address pivotal questions about economic
incentive structures, perverse implications, distribution of power, and
redistribution of welfare; and to ground research on fairness,
accountability, and transparency in existing legal requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, the more recent <a href="https://responsiblecomputing.org/">Foundations of Responsible
Computing</a> (FORC) emphasises the
mathematical, algorithmic, statistical and economics aspects
of responsible computing. From the FORC website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Symposium on Foundations of Responsible Computing (FORC) is a forum for
mathematical research in computation and society writ large.  The Symposium
aims to catalyze the formation of a community supportive of the application
of theoretical computer science, statistics, economics and other relevant
analytical fields to problems of pressing and anticipated societal concern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as cryptography is inherently political, algorithmic fairness is
inherently social and political so it will be interesting to see how this
community chooses to evolve.</p>
