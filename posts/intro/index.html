  <p>In Fall 2019, I taught a course called <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~seny/2950v/">Crypto for Social
Good</a>. I didn&rsquo;t like the name but I had to
make a quick decision and that was the best I could come up with at the time.
I had a sense of the topics I wanted to cover but I didn&rsquo;t have a way to
capture the essence of the course.</p>
<p>In fact, on the first day of class I told my students:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what this course is about, but we&rsquo;re going to figure it
out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we did. What we found is that the course was about <em>the impact of computer
science and technology on marginalized groups</em>. The course had a privacy and
surveillance bias to it because that&rsquo;s what I work on, but we had
students from a variety of CS backgrounds including AI/ML, robotics and systems
so our discussions ended up being somewhat broader (though we unfortunately did
not have any students from the social sciences).</p>
<p>My motivation for creating the course was frustration. I have studied computer
science for almost 25 years.  I have worked on cryptography for over 15 years.
I worked at Microsoft Research for 8 years. I spent a year and half on a
National Academy of Sciences committee studying the impact of encryption on law
enforcement and national security. I went all the way from being a confused
undergraduate computer science major to an Associate Professor  and, until very recently,
I never attended a lecture or had a conversation with other computer scientists about
the specific impact that technology has on marginalized groups.</p>
<p>Of course, teaching and research on this subject did exist <em>outside of CS</em> but
my point is that I never encountered any <em>computer science</em> work that focused
on the experiences of marginalized people.  This leads me to believe that, as a
field, we don&rsquo;t really care.  At least not in a meaningful way.  We write
diversity and inclusion statements but we don&rsquo;t do research or build
technologies that address the problems of marginalized communities.</p>
<p>So this is why I created the course. But what is <em>this blog</em> about? During our
time together, my students and I read, analyzed and discussed many
reports and articles and we thought a lot about computer science&rsquo;s role (and
sometimes absence) in various social problems. We thought about the problems that different
communities were facing and whether technology-based solutions even made
sense (often they didn&rsquo;t!). In some cases, we also sketched new technologies
that could potentially impact these communities in a positive way. None of
these discussions were authoritative. We didn&rsquo;t come up with any definitive
answers; but we weren&rsquo;t trying to. Our goal was to educate ourselves and
reflect. To imagine what computer science would look like if the interests of
marginalized people were taken seriously by the field.</p>
<p>I think the results of our work are important and, as far as I know, somewhat
unique so this blog will serve as a way to communicate them to those who are
interested.  I will post summaries and analyses of our readings and,
eventually, the research that came out of that.</p>
<p>Posts related to class discussions will be authored as a group named 2950v-XX,
where XX will be the course year. I decided on group authorship to
protect the students&rsquo; privacy and to avoid them being targeted.</p>
<p>For Fall 2020, I plan on broadening the class beyond crypto and on changing the
name to “Algorithms for the People”. I feel that it better captures what the
course was always about; even if I didn&rsquo;t realize it at first.</p>
